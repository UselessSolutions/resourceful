## About

Resourceful is a texture pack utility mod for BTA which allows you to use multiple texture packs at the same time, texturepacks are applied bottom to top meaning the highest packs in the list have the most priority.

## Usage
Resourceful should recognize any packs that BTA would normally recognize. 

You can rearrage your pack list by first selecting a pack by left clicking on it and then pressing the up or down arrow buttons to shift it up or down. Holding shift when pressing the up or down buttons with force the selection to the top or the bottom of the list respectively.

You can toggle packs on or off by either double clicking a pack or by pressing the left/right arrow button with a pack selected.

Texture packs only truly apply once you presh the circler refresh button at the bottom, or when you leave the GUI.
